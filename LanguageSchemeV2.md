Main idea -- write math, not code.
Latex format.
Compiled in pdf and fortran.

Comments
---
`!` -- working code for tex, comment in f90 (not in scr.f90 at all)  
`%` -- working code for f90, comment in tex (not in scr.tex at all)  
`#` -- comment everywhere  
TODO  
`#!` -- actual comment in f90, that can be seen in src.f90  
`#%` -- comment in tex, working code for f90  

Variable Declaration
---
Before using, variable needs to be declared
`var a b c`
`\var a b c`
TODO need to be more consistent with latex
`\var{  a b c
        d e f }`
